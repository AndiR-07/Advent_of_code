# Advent_of_code
some of my codes that solved Advent of Code problems.

**Note:** 
- all of the programs need an input file with the name "day_Nr_of_day.in" and an output file with the name "day_Nr_of_day.out".  
For example "day1.in" for input, "day1.out" for output.
- I do not guarantee that the codes presented will work on any input. The only input i tested them was the one given to by my advent of code seed
